## 📷 How It Works  
1️⃣ **The drone captures live video feeds** from the target area.  
2️⃣ **AI models analyze frames** to detect **fire, crowd density, and violence**.  
3️⃣ **Alerts are triggered** if a threat is identified.  
4️⃣ **The system logs events and notifies authorities** in real time.
